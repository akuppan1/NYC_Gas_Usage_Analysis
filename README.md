# NYCHA's Gas Usage Analysis
I was perusing the NYC Open Data Website again, looking for real estate related data. Something caught my eye. The gas usage dataset that I found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Heating-Gas-Consumption-And-Cost-2010-2020-/it56-eyq4
</br></br>
In general, I was curious about what the utility bills are like for large apartment buildings. I see those utility ratings everywhere we go on buildings in NYC. The dataset was a straightforward record-keeping of all of the development buildings under NYC's housing authority. I found some interesting things below:

Here we see a tally of any occurrences of gas payments per yearFrom the above graph, we see 2 spikes from the baseline counts of any occurrences of gas payments per year. The 2012 spike I did some digging and found this article from NYCHA: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nycha/about/press/pr-2012/nycha-extends-eviction-moratorium.page
</br></br>

Hurricane Sandy seemed to have affected enough people to cause that spike. You can take a wild guess why in 2020 there was a spike (*cough* COVID *cough*).

Here we see the value counts of all the types of buildings NYCHA has</br></br>

Here we see all the energy vendors NYCHA had over the years. Major ones are ConEd and National GridFederally funded mostly</br></br>

Again, we see the major utility vendorsBrooklyn seems to have the most developments from NYCHA

We see from the account names that the properties are located in Brooklyn</br></br>

Here we see the average charges for gas per year for all buildings.

Sure, I was curious about the gas charges, but there are so many unknowns at play. Inflation, global warming, new gas laws, new gas prices, amongst other things have to be factored in to making any kind of concrete takeaways. From the analysis of this data, however, I did find some interesting things. 2020 had a spike in gas payments maybe because NYCHA had to provide more units to people who were seeking a living place. This was similar to 2012 where NYC was affected by Hurricane Sandy. Also, we can see that most of these properties are government funded, which is great. I'm glad my tax dollars are helping out those in need.
